# Binary Tree Visualization Project

This project is an interactive **Binary Tree Visualization Tool** that allows users to visualize different types of binary trees (e.g., Binary Trees, Max-Heaps, and Binary Search Trees) and arrays with real-time updates and smooth animations.

## Features

- **Interactive Controls**: Zoom in/out, reset, and clear the tree visualization.
- **Real-time Updates**: The tree updates in real-time as users input or modify data.
- **Export Feature**: Export the current tree visualization as a PNG image for easy sharing.
- **Multiple Visualization Modes**: 
  - Binary Tree Visualization
  - Max-Heap Visualization
  - Binary Search Tree Visualization
- **Custom Animations**: Smooth transitions and visual effects when nodes are added or removed.

## Project Structure

- **HTML/JS Files**: The core logic for the visualizations is handled in JavaScript files (`app.js`, `nodes.js`, `heap.js`) with D3.js for rendering.
- **CSS**: The design is powered by a modern, user-friendly interface with interactive elements and hover effects.
